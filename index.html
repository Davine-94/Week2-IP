            Hi there! Thank you for being here. This application works through taking your birthday input, calculating the day of the week that you were born.
            Depending on you gender input, and date of birth, the application will output your Akan name. A name is an element of human experience. Even though names are purely experiential, knowing your Akan name may help you understand the philosophy and worldview of the society.
            Akan personal name system and practice is a marker of people's belief,
            ideology, religion, culture, philosophy and thought. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akan_names">Learn More</a>
